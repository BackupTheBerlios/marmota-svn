How to compile Marmota
======================


This is an introduction hwo to comile marmota.
The Ant-Scripts, and its Extensions, are developed to work with a running GNU/Linux-OS. Actually [1] there seems to be ar problem compiling the project while running Windows, within one of the Ant-Extensions.

This is will only explain how to compile the core-application and the core-plugins. An introduction to write and compile own extensions will follow in another document.

The whole compile-system base on the main-"build.xml" in the root directory. It will call all the "build.xml"-files in the subdirectories.
The core and every plugin must have its own "build.xml" and it can be called directly and stand alone. But note: Plugins must have the core-sytem in the classpath.

To compile the core you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) >= 1.6 (Java 6)
- Ant (an build-tool)


So you can call the ant-script with the command:

ant [option]

[option] can be:

     clean           - cleanup all directories
     compilecore     - compile marmota core
     compileplugins  - compile marmota core
     publish         - compile and publish
                       the core and all plugins



By the way, all way: The plugins should hava the following Ant-Syntax:


ant [option]

[option] can be:

     ant clean           - cleanup all directories
     ant compile         - compile plugin
     ant publish         - publish the plugin


If you run the ant-script in the root-directory, it will call all ant-scripts recursiv in the subdirectories with the same opton.
So, if you run "ant compile" in the root directory, it will run all other scripts with the option "compile".
